# 12. Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it is a problem | Alternative |
|---|---|---|
| Anemic Domain Model | logic scattered in services, invariants unprotected | behavior on the aggregate |
| God Aggregate | huge transactions, lock contention, not extractable | split by real consistency boundaries; reference by ID |
| God / Fat Application Service | a service class that grows unbounded: many methods, many unrelated concerns, many deps | one service per aggregate module (Section 6.2); the checker warns past ~7 methods, ~200 lines, or 5 constructor params - look at the aggregate before splitting the service |
| Fat Controller / Fat Entrypoint | untestable without transport, logic not reusable | entrypoint only translates + calls one service method |
| Business logic in adapters | hidden from domain tests, duplicated | adapters only translate; decisions in domain/application |
| Repository as business service | business queries leak into persistence, repo grows unbounded | repo = collection of roots; complex reads -> read model |
| Domain imports infrastructure / frameworks | domain not testable in isolation, tech locked in | DIP - domain defines ports, infra implements |
| Active Record aggregate | invariants entangled with the DB, not unit-testable | data mapper; plain aggregate |
| Shared module as junk drawer | global coupling, contexts cannot evolve independently | strict `commons` / `shared_kernel` rules; duplicate by default |
| Cross-context coupling | contexts fused, not independently deployable | integration events + ACL; zero imports (ARCH-012) |
| Premature abstraction | indirection with no payoff, wrong abstraction locks in | YAGNI + Progressive Structure; abstract on 2+ concrete cases |
| Domain leaking across the application boundary | transport coupled to the internal model | use case returns a DTO; map in application |
| Setter-driven aggregates | illegal state transitions, invariants bypassed | intention-revealing methods that validate |
| CRUD use cases | no business intent, invariants unverifiable per change | intention-revealing use cases |
| Event as command | hidden coupling, a synchronous call in disguise | events are past-tense facts; send a command to make something happen |
| Mock-heavy tests | tests couple to implementation, refactors break tests | real domain + in-memory fakes; assert on state and events |
